# Thermoradiative Cells in the III-V Group (GaAs, GaSb, InAs, InP)

This repository features code to analyze the performance of thermoradiative (TR) cells made from III-V group materials, such as GaAs, GaSb, InAs, and InP, characterized by a direct bandgap in a cubic lattice with a zinc-blende structure.
